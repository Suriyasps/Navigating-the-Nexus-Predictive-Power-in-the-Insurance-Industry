## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project supports Imperial Ltd.'s life insurance marketing initiative by building a **predictive model** using customer demographic, behavioral, and transactional data. The goal: **identify potential buyers of life insurance** to enable **targeted marketing** and increase ROI.

---

## ðŸ§­ Methodology: CRISP-DM Framework

1. **Business Understanding**: Use predictive analytics to identify high-likelihood buyers.
2. **Data Understanding**: Explore demographic and financial indicators across 4,000+ records.
3. **Data Preparation**:
   - Cleaned missing and inconsistent values
   - Used NLP-inspired logic to preprocess categorical fields (e.g., standardizing 'marriage', 'child', 'online' fields)
4. **Modeling**:
   - Random Forest
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
5. **Evaluation**: Precision, recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC
6. **Deployment**: Prepare model insights for use in marketing targeting tools

## ðŸ§® Models Used

### ðŸŒ² Random Forest
- Baseline accuracy: **88.4%**, improved to **89.6%** via hyperparameter tuning.
- Feature importance: `'online'` is the most predictive variable.
- ROC-AUC: **0.93**, showing strong class separation.
- Hyperparameters tuned via `GridSearchCV`.

### ðŸ’¡ Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Multiple models with polynomial and linear kernels.
- Final tuned model: **89% accuracy**, AUC of **0.91**.
- Conservative prediction threshold to avoid false positives.

### ðŸ§  Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- Input layer: 128 neurons, ReLU activation
- Dropout layers used to prevent overfitting
- Accuracy: **~90%**
- ROC-AUC: **0.93**
- F1 score optimized at **threshold 0.81**

## ðŸ“Š Visual Analysis Highlights

- **Gender & Life Insurance**: Males more likely to purchase
- **Marital Status**: Married individuals more inclined toward life insurance
- **Family Income & Region**: Strong geographic and economic segmentation
- **Occupation**: Professionals are top buyers of life insurance
- **Correlation Matrix**: Digital engagement and age most impactful

## ðŸ§  Tools & Technologies

- **Language & Libraries**: Python (`pandas`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `keras`, `matplotlib`)
- **NLP Techniques**:
  - Standardization of demographic attributes based on context (e.g., child, marriage)
  - Categorical encoding informed by text processing strategies
- **ML Algorithms**:
  - `RandomForestClassifier`
  - `SVC`
  - `Keras Sequential API`
